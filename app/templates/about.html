                &emsp;&emsp;I am currently a student of CS the department at Huazhong University of Sci & Tech, pursuing the master degree in computer science. Before I step into the world of computer science, I got my B.Sc. degree in statistics from Math and Statistics Department at HUST.

                &emsp;&emsp;My research field mainly focuses on deep learning. As a "freshman" in CS field, I have a strong curiosity about CS area, and have great interests in learning different kinds of practical skills.

                &emsp;&emsp;In my leisure time, I enjoy playing games and watching movies, especially those with sci-fi elements. The best movie in my heart is the Intersteller. And that is why I chose Gargantua, which is a symbolic mark of the movie, as my profile picture.

                &emsp;&emsp;My motto is "I think, therefore I am." coming from Descartes. The ability of thinking makes us human. The ability of thinking deeply makes us extraordinary.
